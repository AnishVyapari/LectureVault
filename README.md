## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot not responding to commands:**
- Ensure the bot has proper permissions in your Discord server
- Verify the bot token is correct in `bot_config.json`
- Check that slash commands are synced (may take up to 1 hour)

**Recording not working:**
- Confirm you're running on Windows (required for screen recording)
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify sufficient disk space for recordings

**Upload failures:**
- Ensure file sizes are under Discord's limit (8MB for free servers, 50MB for Nitro)
- Check bot has `ATTACH_FILES` permission in the target channel
